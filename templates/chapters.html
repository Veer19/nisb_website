                        IEEE has many societies under its umbrella. One of its largest and most active societies is the IEEE Computer Society. NISB has started its Computer Society chapter two years ago with only 15 members and currently has a whopping a figure of 60 members. Through NISB, IEEE students of NIE can take up student membership for the Computer Society
